Since 1.3.19

* orginizational
  * moved all packages from org.qooxdoo.sushi to de.ui.sushi
  * moved compiler module back to Mork Project
  * merged ssh- and svn modules into core module, making their dependencies optional
  * turned multi-module-build (with the only remaining module (core)) into a normal build

* Strings
  * escape method added
  * toHex method added

* Java 6
  * javac source and target 1.6
  * dump io.Misc because it's part of 6
  * dump util.Misc.getXercesName

* added Buffer.fill(InputStream in, Buffer, int start, int max, boolean[] eof)
* xml.ChildElements added
* xml.Namespace added
* xml.Builder.element and textElement with Namespace
* dump life support, it's part of pustefix now

* fs
  * Node methods
    * move: added default implementation that uses copy and delete
    * readBytes optimized by overriding the default implementation in various sub-classes
    * append now implemented for all filesystems
    * length clarified: now throws an exception when not applied to a file
    * list clarified
      * throw an exception if this does not exist
      * fix MemoryNode
    * digestBytes added to obtain raw bytes
    * close clarify close behavior: close more than once is ok, but read/write closed stream
      yields an exception
    * diff fixed:
      * avoid reading from a closed stream
      * adding close after the diff
  * Links
    * added Node.isLink, Node.link, Node.mklink and Node.readLink
    * FileNode.isLink returns true for broken links now
    * FileNode.exists returns true for broken links now
    * link support for filters
      * added Filter.followLinks
      * added Predicate.LINK and Predicate.NON_LINK
      * added isLink argument to Predicate.matches
      * added isLink argument to all Action methods

      * Filesystem.rootNode changed
      * IO.TOOD changes
    * moved META-INF/sushi/filesystems to META-INF/de/ui/sushi/filesystem
      to avoid collisions with sushi 1.x.
    * optional filesystems: silently ignore Filesystem instantiation problems if the classname
      is marked with a star. Needed to support optional dependencies.
    * added Filesystem.getFeatures to programmatically check available features
    * SEPARATOR renamed to SCHEME_SEPARATOR
    * getName renamed to getScheme
    * multiple schemes for filesystems
  * ZipNodes
    * uses uri to reference jar file now
    * added ZipNode.length support
    * fix exists and isDirectory for root node (aka empty path): properly return true now
  * WebdavNodes added
  * HttpNodes dumped. Use WebdavNodes instead
  * ResourceNodes dumped. Use IO.resource and IO.resources instead
  * SshNodes: isFile and isDirectory properly propagate exceptions now
